# Bike-Sharing-in-San-Francisco
SQL + Power BI Project to uncover the trends in usage,  of share bikes

## üìå Objective

## üîß Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Cleaned and formatted data in BigQuery
- Removed null values, fixed data types, deduplicated rows
  
## üß† Key SQL Queries (BigQuery)

```sql
-- only Trips in San Francisco are relevant to this project
SELECT * 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id
WHERE stations.landmark = 'San Francisco'
```
- Find out the most popular route in San Francisco among subscriber and customer<br>
```sql
WITH SF_trips AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips` as trips
  JOIN `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_stations` as stations
  ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id
  WHERE stations.landmark = 'San Francisco'

)
SELECT
   start_station_name,
   end_station_name,
   COUNT(*) AS trip_count,
   SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN subscriber_type = 'Customer'  
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END) AS Customer_Count,
    SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN subscriber_type = 'Subscriber' 
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END) AS Subscriber_Count
FROM SF_trips
GROUP BY 
  start_station_name,
  end_station_name
ORDERY BY
  trip_count DESC
```
- Find out most popular riding duration<br>
```sql
WITH duration AS (
  SELECT
    ROUND((duration_sec/60), 0) AS mins,
    subscriber_type
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips`
  ORDER BY mins
) 
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN duration.mins <= 5 THEN 'Short (<5 min)'
    WHEN duration.mins BETWEEN 6 AND 20 THEN 'Medium (5-20 min)'
    WHEN duration.mins BETWEEN 21 AND 60 THEN 'Long (20-60 min)'
    ELSE 'Very Long (>60 min)'
  END AS duration_category,
  COUNT(*) as no_of_cat,
  SUM(CASE 
    WHEN subscriber_type = 'Customer' 
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END) AS total_customer,
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN subscriber_type = 'Subscriber'
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END) AS total_subscriber
FROM duration
GROUP BY duration_category
```

## üìà Power BI Dashboard  
- Built interactive visuals: bar charts, slicers, and KPIs
- Added filters for date range, agent name, and satisfaction score
- Summary KPIs: Avg Response Time, % Satisfied Customers, Volume by Channel

## üí° Key Insights
- Response time is highest during weekends.
- Agent X consistently outperforms others in customer satisfaction.
- Chat support has higher resolution rate than email.

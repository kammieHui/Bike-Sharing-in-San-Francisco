## üîß Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Cleaned and formatted data in BigQuery
- Removed null values, fixed data types, deduplicated rows
  
## üß† Key SQL Queries (BigQuery)

JOIN `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id
WHERE stations.landmark = 'San Francisco'
```
- <b>Find out the most popular route in San Francisco among subscriber and customer</b><br>
```sql

- <b>Find out houly bikes availability on each stations</b><br>
```sql
WITH average_hour_availability AS ( 
  SELECT 
    station_id, 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM time) AS hour, 
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM time) AS day_of_week, -- Extracts day of the week (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday)
    ROUND(AVG(bikes_available),2) AS avg_bikes_available, 
    ROUND(AVG(docks_available),2) AS avg_docks_available
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_status` 
  GROUP BY station_id, hour, day_of_week
) 

SELECT
  a.station_id,
  s.name, 
  a.hour, 
  a.day_of_week,  
  a.avg_bikes_available, 
  a.avg_docks_available, 
  ROUND((a.avg_bikes_available - a.avg_docks_available), 2) AS difference_avail
FROM average_hour_availability AS a
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_stations` AS s
ON a.station_id = s.station_id
WHERE s.landmark = 'San Francisco'

## üìà Power BI Report  
Report includes:-<br>
- <b>Cards</b> - Overview of total rides, number of stations, and active bikes 
- <b>Tables</b> - Popular Routes, top start stations and underused stations
- <b>Stacked Bar Charts</b> - Ride duration preference, ride growth, bike usuage longevity
- <b>Line Charts with Slicer</b> - Hourly bikes availability across different stations and days of the week

## üí° Key Insights
- Some of the Station are significantly underused compared to others.
- Most Popular Ride duration is around 5 - 20 mins.
- Annual/30-day subscribers account for the majority of rides ‚Äî 7 to 8 times more than 24‚Äì72 hour users.
- Around half of the bikes are heavily underutilized compared to the other half. Some individual bikes are heavily used. Further investigation may help optimize bike distribution and increase lifespan.
- Peak bike availability hours vary across stations. While no clear pattern is concluded, observing station-level trends may support more strategic resource planning.

## üìé Files Included
- `queries.sql`: SQL scripts used in BigQuery
- [`Report/PowerBI_SF_share bikes_v.1.1.pdf`](./Report/PowerBI_SF_share%20bikes_v.1.1.pdf): Exported Power BI Report
- `README.md`: This project summary

## üìö Learnings
- More hands-on practice with SQL using BigQuery, especially with JOINs, CTEs, and window functions
- Learned how to clean and prepare data for analysis (e.g. fixing formats, removing duplicates, filtering relevant rows)
- connected BigQuery to Power BI and worked through setting up the data model
- Built a Power BI dashboard using cards, tables, bar and line charts, and slicers
- Practiced visualizing data to highlight trends and make the report easier to understand
- Learned how to document the project clearly in a structured GitHub README
